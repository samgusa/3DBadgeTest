# 3DBadgeTest

This is a fun project that I am working on. I recently passed my CompTIA Security + certification, and I want to show my certification on my phone. I am going to do this by creating a 3D shape of my certification, in different shapes. 

I think that I am going to try other ways to improve this as well. 

## 3D Shapes:

## Data about SceneKit and SCN: 

SceneKit is the Xcode native framework that can be used to create 3D shapes. SceneKit has 9 base shapes that can be used. They are: SCNPlane, SCNBox, SCNSphere, SCNPyramid, SCNCone, SCNCylinder, SCNCapsule, SCNTube, and SCNTorus.

Here is more data on that: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/scenekit/scngeometry

While these are the built in shapes, there are ways to create your own custom 3D shape. Using this link to a github page, I found a way to try and create my own 3D shapes, which in my case is the triangular prism and diamond prism. 


## Things I figured out: 

I realized that there I would need to create the same setup code many times, for each 3D shape that I wanted to create. This annoyed me, because in the future I would have to create the same code multiple times. I beleive that the best thing to do when programming is to reduce your work to the best of our abilities, hence I thought of making something that can be reusable.
